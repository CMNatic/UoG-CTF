#UoG CTF

## Introduction
> The following repo is a personal project, revision tool, as well as a proposed service for University of Gloucestershire Comp Sci students. The front-end is from the [CTFd platform](https://github.com/CTFd), however the back-end is entirely implemented with Docker, for ultimate scalability and portability.

> I started this because running a CTF in the Cloud is super expensive (atleast with my budgeting), where you'd have to deploy multiple instances e.g. EC2 on AWS for a some-what feasible CTF. This is designed to be able to run off of one/two machines, but still retain the attractiveness of Users logging into shells.
